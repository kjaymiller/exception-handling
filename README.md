# Exception Handling in Python - (VS Code Explains Episode 2)

## Why handle exceptions?

Exceptions are errors that occur during the execution of a program. They disrupt the normal flow of the program and usually end it abruptly. Exceptions are a common occurrence in programming and should be handled to prevent the program from crashing.

## How to handle exceptions?

Exceptions can be handled generally with the `try`, and `except`. The `try` block contains the code that is to be executed. The `except` block contains the code that is to be executed if an exception occurs.
